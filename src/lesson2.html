      <h1>Lesson 2: Browser Developer Tools</h1>
      <p>
        You can use browser developer tools to see the HTML, CSS, and JS of any
        website. You can also use them to debug your own code.
      </p>
      <p>
        On windows, you can open the developer tools by pressing F12 or
        Ctrl+Shift+I. On Mac, Cmd+Opt+I. You can also right click on any element
        on the page and click "Inspect" to open the developer tools. On Mac, you
        can "right click" by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking. If you
        are on mobile, you may consider using a desktop browser to take this
        course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take a moment to open the developer tools and look at the HTML, CSS, and
        JS of this page and feel free to keep it open as you take this course,
        if you are curious, and you might learn more about how this website
        works. To close, you can repeat the same key combination you used to
        open the developer tools or click the "X" in the top right corner of the
        developer tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another tip: browser dev tools supports docking options: click on the 3
        dots menu in the upper right of the dev tools. Arrange the dev tools in
        a way that works best for you.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Undock into separate window</li>
        <li>Dock to bottom</li>
        <li>Do to right</li>
        <li>Dock to left (many browsers)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Learning browser dev tools could be an entire course in itself.</p>
