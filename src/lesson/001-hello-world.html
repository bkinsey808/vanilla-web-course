          In this course we will learn about Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. This is the
          most fundamental way to build web sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Vanilla</em></strong> means no frameworks or libraries.
          It's just you and the browser. It's the <em>bare metal</em> of the web
          and a great way to learn how the web works.

          One of the things that makes the web a <mark>great platform</mark> for
          developers is how <mark>open</mark> it is. Under the hood, you can
          view the HTML, CSS, and JS of almost any website. In fact, assuming
          you have access to the developer tools of your browser, you can take a
          peek at the HTML, CSS, and JS of this website you are on right now.
