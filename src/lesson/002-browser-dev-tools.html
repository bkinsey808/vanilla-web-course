          You can use browser developer tools to see the HTML, CSS, and JS of
          any website. You can also use them to debug your own code.
        </p>
        <p>
          On windows, you can open the developer tools by pressing
          <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>. On
          Mac, <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>. You can also right
          click on any element on the page and click "Inspect" to open the
          developer tools. On Mac, you can "right click" by holding down the
          Ctrl key while clicking. If you are on mobile, you may consider using
          a desktop browser to take this course.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take a moment to open the developer tools and look at the HTML, CSS,
          and JS of this page and feel free to keep it open as you take this
          course, if you are curious, and you might learn more about how this
          website works. To close, you can repeat the same key combination you
          used to open the developer tools or click the "&#x2716;" in the top
          right corner of the developer tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another tip: browser dev tools supports docking options: click on the
          3 dots menu in the upper right of the dev tools. Arrange the dev tools
          in a way that works best for you.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Undock into separate window</li>
          <li>Dock to bottom</li>
          <li>Do to right</li>
          <li>Dock to left (many browsers)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Learning browser dev tools could be an entire course in itself.</p>
