          This course is intended to be fully interactive. If you are at all
          able to set up your own coding environment, the fastest way to learn
          this material is to actually get a copy of this project (clone the
          repo), install git and npm on your operating system, and run the
          following commands in a terminal to get set up:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
              git clone https://github.com/bkinsey808/vanilla-web-course
              cd vanilla-web-course
              npm i -g pnpm 
              pnpm i 
            </pre
          >
        </code>
        <p>Then you can run the project with the command:</p>
        <code>
          <pre>
              pnpm start
          </pre>
        </code>

        <p>
          If you are looking for a code editor recommendation, I recommend
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.
          However, the reality is many students do not have access to a computer
          that they can install software on. If that is the case for you, you
          can use an online code editor called Stackblitz. You can use it right
          in your browser: no need to install anything. More detailed
          instructions how to get set up with Stackblitz are coming. For now the
          important thing to know is that Stackblitz supports two code editors,
          the "Classic" version and the new one called Codeflow. I recommend
          using Codeflow if it works for you, and fall back on Classic if it
          doesn't. What's amazing about Codeflow is the interface is about as
          close to Visual Studio Code as possible in a web browser.
        </p>

        <!-- npm i -g pnpm pnpm i pnpm start change the source code and see what
          happens. If you are looking for a code editor recommendation, I
          recommend
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.

          All you need is a computer with a web browser. I will teach you to use
          an online code editor called Stackblitz. You can use it right in your
          browser. No need to install anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you change the code in Stackblitz, the changes will be reflected
          in the browser. This is called <strong>live reloading</strong>. It's a
          great way to learn because you can see the results of your changes
          immediately.
