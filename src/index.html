      <h1>Lesson 1: Hello world!</h1>
      <p>
        In this course we will learn about Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. This is the most
        fundamental way to build web sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Vanilla</em></strong> means no frameworks or libraries. It's
        just you and the browser. It's the <em>bare metal</em> of the web and a
        great way to learn how the web works.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the things that makes the web a <mark>great platform</mark> for
        developers is how <mark>open</mark> it is. Under the hood, you can view
        the HTML, CSS, and JS of any almost any website. In fact, assuming you
        have access to the developer tools of your browser, you can take a peek
        at the HTML, CSS, and JS of this website you are on right now.
